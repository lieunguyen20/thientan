                  <h2>What We Stand For</h2>										
                  <h3>Customer Satisfaction</h3>
                  <p>At B&amp;H, we will never give you the "hard sell", or try to convince you to purchase something you don't need. We value your patronage and always aim to provide a great shopping experience. You're invited to call us, chat with us, or visit in personâ€”we're waiting to serve you. We'll give you all the time you need to discuss your concerns and graciously welcome any request.</p>
                  <h3>True Know-How</h3>
                  <p>We recruit photography, audio and video specialists as salespeople. By hiring so many accomplished experts, we place years of industry experience and advice at your disposal.</p>
                  <p>In addition to their own experience, B&amp;H associates spend more than 25% of their working time in equipment trainings. Our technology courses teach the science behind the gear we carry, and talks on technique and artistic expression offer insight into how working pros best utilize their equipment. Product training involves demonstrations by manufacturer representatives on the use of new items. Our experts extend their experience to train each other as well, sharing new technologies and ideas. Talk to our pros to find out the latest in equipment development and applications.</p>
                  <h3>Superior Value</h3>
                  <p>B&amp;H always offers great prices around the clock, every day. Our extensive selection and business relationships allow us to make deals that translate to exceptional savings for you.</p>
                  <h3>Amazing Selection</h3>
                  <p>B&amp;H maintains ample stock of many manufacturers' full product lines, from highly popular brands to obscure, hard-to-find accessories. Our only concern is having the item <i>you</i> need when <i>you</i> need it. And thanks to our precise inventory tracking, if a product is listed as being in stock, you can be sure we have it available for you.</p>

                <div class="history-text">
                  <p>B&amp;H began as a "mom and pop" shop in 1973. After wife-and-husband partners (Blimie and Herman, respectively) opened the doors in Tribeca with one employee, their trademark dedication to candid selling and quality merchandise quickly attracted a loyal following of photo, video and audio professionals.</p>
                  <p>At a time when shysters abounded, we developed a reputation for honesty and ethical business practices, and the word spread.</p>
                  <p>Today, as the USA's largest non-chain specialty electronics retailer, we deliver that same pioneering integrity via specialized showrooms, classes and tutorials, and as always, unparalleled inventory and service on a daily basis. We continue to expand to meet your needs with showrooms, classes, helpful educational and social media content, serving customers worldwide from our highly rated website, award-winning mobile Apps, catalogs and our 34th Street "SuperStore."</p>
