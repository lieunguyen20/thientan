                          If your order is shipping to an address in a state which either requires us to collect sales tax, or is being picked up in our Manhattan SuperStore, local sales tax will be automatically assessed unless the account is registered as tax-exempt. In some cases, we may provide an estimated sales tax amount until your exact location is finalized prior to order completion.
                          In addition, we are legally required to report certain purchases to local taxation departments in Puerto Rico. If you reside in this area, please check with your local government to see if your purchases are subject to a use tax.

                          If your order is shipping to an address in a state which either requires us to collect sales tax, or is being picked up in our Manhattan SuperStore, local sales tax will be automatically assessed unless the account is registered as tax-exempt. In some cases, we may provide an estimated sales tax amount until your exact location is finalized prior to order completion.
                          In addition, we are legally required to report certain purchases to local taxation departments in Puerto Rico. If you reside in this area, please check with your local government to see if your purchases are subject to a use tax.

                         If your order is shipping to an address in a state which either requires us to collect sales tax, or is being picked up in our Manhattan SuperStore, local sales tax will be automatically assessed unless the account is registered as tax-exempt. In some cases, we may provide an estimated sales tax amount until your exact location is finalized prior to order completion.
                         In addition, we are legally required to report certain purchases to local taxation departments in Puerto Rico. If you reside in this area, please check with your local government to see if your purchases are subject to a use tax.
